# Safeguards

Safeguards are mandatory controls to prevent harmful, misleading, or non-compliant outcomes.

## Mandatory Checklist

Before policy approval, confirm:

- [ ] Claims are backed by reliable evidence.
- [ ] Safety risks and contraindications are documented.
- [ ] Vulnerable populations are considered.
- [ ] Language avoids discrimination, shame, or coercion.
- [ ] Regulatory constraints are reviewed for target regions.
- [ ] User-facing content is understandable and not deceptive.

## Red Lines

Policies must not:

- Encourage unsafe use patterns.
- Present unverified claims as facts.
- Minimize known risks.
- Exploit insecurities or identity-based harms.

## Incident Response

If a potential harm is identified:

1. Pause related policy rollout.
2. Open an incident record with timestamp and owner.
3. Assess severity and user impact.
4. Issue corrective update and communication.
5. Add preventive action to safeguards.
