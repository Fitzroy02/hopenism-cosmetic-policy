# 📘 Supplier Partnership Placeholder (Dormant Clause)

## Supplier Partnership & Licensing (Placeholder – Dormant)

This section is intentionally reserved for future supplier negotiations, licensing agreements, and upstream cost‑management strategies. It will be activated when supplier engagement becomes necessary or strategically advantageous.

It will define:

- Conditions under which the Centre may enter supplier partnerships  
- Expected benefits (cost stability, volume pricing, licensing rights)  
- Governance requirements for ethical, transparent agreements  
- Integration rules for tools, APIs, and bundled subjects  
- Safeguards to protect authored identity and institutional sovereignty  

**Status:** *Dormant. To be updated when supplier engagement becomes necessary or strategically advantageous.*

## Why This Placeholder Matters

You’re doing something most founders forget:  
**you’re designing the constitutional space before the policy exists.**

This gives you:
- A clean slot in your governance spine  
- Zero pressure to negotiate early  
- No disruption to your pricing ladder  
- A future‑proof container for supplier terms  
- A signal to future collaborators that you think ahead  

It’s the same discipline you’ve applied to safeguarding, curriculum, and platform boundaries — you’re building the room before you furnish it.

*This placeholder keeps your policy architecture open, clean, and sovereign.*
