# Culture

Culture defines expected behavior while creating and maintaining policy.

## Working Norms

- **Clarity over jargon**: write for broad understanding.
- **Debate ideas, respect people**: challenge decisions without personal attacks.
- **Evidence over hierarchy**: stronger evidence carries more weight than seniority.
- **Document before memory**: decisions live in writing, not verbal context.
- **Own outcomes**: acknowledge mistakes and ship corrections quickly.

## Collaboration Expectations

- Give actionable feedback with examples.
- Raise concerns early, especially on safety and fairness.
- Prefer small, auditable changes over large undocumented shifts.

## Healthy Escalation

Escalation is encouraged when:

- Safety risks are disputed,
- Claims are weakly supported,
- Release pressure conflicts with safeguards.

Escalations should include context, alternatives considered, and a requested decision deadline.
