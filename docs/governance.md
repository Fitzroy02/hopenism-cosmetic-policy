# Governance

Governance defines who decides, how they decide, and how decisions are recorded.

## Roles

- **Policy Owner**: Final decision-maker for policy acceptance.
- **Safety Reviewer**: Evaluates health, misuse, and harm risk.
- **Evidence Reviewer**: Checks quality and relevance of supporting evidence.
- **Documentation Steward**: Maintains clarity, versioning, and change records.

## Decision Workflow

1. Draft proposal with objective and expected impact.
2. Gather evidence and risk notes.
3. Run safeguards checklist.
4. Conduct role-based review.
5. Approve, request changes, or reject.
6. Publish with effective date and changelog entry.

## Decision Rules

- No policy is approved without documented rationale.
- Any unresolved safety concern blocks approval.
- Conflicts are escalated to Policy Owner with recorded dissent.

## Cadence

- Monthly policy review for active documents.
- Immediate out-of-cycle review for safety incidents or regulatory updates.
