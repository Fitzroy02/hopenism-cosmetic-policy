# CAMERA & MICROPHONE TRANSPARENCY STANDARD

## 1. Activation Rules
A camera or microphone **cannot** activate unless:

- the user taps an explicit "Allow Camera/Microphone" button
- the system displays a persistent on-screen indicator
- the event is logged in the audit trail

No silent activation.  
No background activation.  
No "soft" permissions.

---

## 2. Mandatory On-Screen Indicator
When the camera is active, the app must show:

- a **visible icon** (camera symbol)
- a **text label** ("Camera Active")
- a **persistent state** (cannot be dismissed)

This replaces the assumption of a hardware red light.

---

## 3. User Awareness Requirements
The user must always know:

- when the camera is on
- who can see them
- whether audio is active
- how to turn it off

This is non-negotiable.

---

## 4. Seller & Marketplace Restrictions
If sellers ever use video (e.g., consultations):

- they must follow the same transparency rules
- they must display the same indicator
- they must not record without explicit consent
- they must not bypass the UI indicator

Violation = immediate suspension.

---

## 5. Audit Trail Requirements
Every camera event must log:

- timestamp
- user ID
- seller ID (if applicable)
- activation method
- duration
- whether recording occurred
- whether consent was given

This protects you legally and culturally.
