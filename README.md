# Safe Cosmetics Marketplace

A governed, transparent, safety-first marketplace for cosmetic products.
This institution exists to protect consumers, uphold regulatory clarity, and elevate standards in cosmetics commerce.

## Our Core Principles

- Soft guardrails
- Traceable authorship
- Protection before profit
- No exploitation of regulatory grey zones
- No enabling unqualified actors

## What This Marketplace Is

A regulated ecosystem where:

- every seller is verified
- every product is documented
- every listing is traceable
- every claim is compliant
- every consumer is protected

## What This Marketplace Is Not

- not an open bazaar
- not a dropshipping platform
- not a loophole for unqualified formulators
- not a space for borderline or medical claims
