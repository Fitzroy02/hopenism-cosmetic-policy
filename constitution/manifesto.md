# Manifesto

We are building a cosmetic marketplace institution grounded in safety, fairness, and truth.

## Commitments

1. Protect consumers before protecting conversion metrics.
2. Enable credible sellers through clear, enforceable standards.
3. Demand evidence for claims and accountability for outcomes.
4. Keep rules legible, reviewable, and consistently enforced.
5. Correct fast when harm, ambiguity, or abuse appears.

## Institutional Promise

Every policy in this repository must strengthen trust, not erode it. We prioritize long-term legitimacy over short-term gain.
