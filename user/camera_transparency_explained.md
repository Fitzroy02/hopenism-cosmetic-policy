# WHY YOU SEE A CAMERA INDICATOR

## 1. Your Safety Comes First
Whenever the camera or microphone is active, you will see a clear on-screen indicator.  
This ensures you always know when video or audio is being used.

---

## 2. What the Indicator Means
- **Camera Active** → You are visible to the other party
- **Microphone Active** → Your audio is being transmitted
- **Camera & Microphone Active** → Both are on

The indicator cannot be hidden or turned off.

---

## 3. You Are Always in Control
You can:

- allow or deny camera access
- allow or deny microphone access
- turn them off at any time
- end the session immediately

---

## 4. Recording Requires Extra Consent
We will **never** record you without:

- a separate prompt
- your explicit approval
- a clear explanation of why

---

## 5. Why This Matters
This protects you from:

- silent recording
- hidden surveillance
- misuse of your image or voice

It also ensures sellers follow strict transparency rules.

---

## 6. Our Commitment
We believe in:

- transparency
- dignity
- user control
- protection before profit

Your privacy is not optional — it is a core part of our governance.
