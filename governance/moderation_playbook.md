# Moderation Playbook

This playbook standardizes incident handling and policy enforcement.

## Incident Levels

- **Level 1 (Low)**: clerical or low-risk compliance drift.
- **Level 2 (Medium)**: misleading claim or repeated minor non-compliance.
- **Level 3 (High)**: safety-critical, fraudulent, or harmful conduct.

## Response Framework

1. Triage report and classify severity.
2. Preserve evidence and record initial facts.
3. Apply immediate containment when needed.
4. Decide action: warning, takedown, restriction, suspension.
5. Communicate outcome and appeal path.
6. Record lessons and control updates.

## Appeals

- Sellers may appeal within defined review window.
- Appeals require documented counter-evidence.
- Final appeal outcomes are recorded and published internally.
