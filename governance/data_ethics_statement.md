# Data Ethics Statement

## Purpose

This statement defines the data ethics principles that govern how user information is collected, used, and protected on the platform. It is designed to be CIC-ready (suitable for Community Interest Company registration and reporting) and suitable for use in funding applications, onboarding flows, and policy frameworks.

## Core Commitments

### 1. Autonomy
Users retain full control over their data at all times. The platform does not make decisions on behalf of users without their explicit, informed consent.

### 2. Minimalism
We collect only the data that is directly necessary for the service the user has requested. Data collection is purposeful and proportionate — never speculative.

### 3. Transparency
Users are told clearly what data is collected, why it is collected, how it is stored, and how it may be used. There are no hidden data practices.

### 4. Anonymity by Default
User profiles and activity data are anonymous unless the user actively and voluntarily chooses to be identified. Identification is always opt-in, never opt-out.

### 5. No Surveillance Logic
The platform does not track user behaviour to build profiles, infer preferences, or predict future actions. There is no behavioural engine. There is no passive data harvesting.

### 6. Governance Alignment
All data practices are governed by this statement, the [Governance Charter](./charter.md), and the [Privacy-First Design Principles](./privacy_first_design.md). No operational decision may override these commitments.

## We Ask. We Do Not Infer.

The platform's data philosophy is grounded in a single, non-negotiable principle:

> **We ask. We do not infer.**

Users tell us what matters to them. We do not watch what they do and draw conclusions. We do not build algorithmic models of their intentions. We do not guess.

This means:

- Preferences are stated, not detected.
- Updates are given, not extracted.
- Consent is explicit, not assumed.

## Consent-First Approach

Every data interaction on this platform begins with a clear, human-readable consent moment. Users are never enrolled into data collection by default. Consent is:

- **Granular** — users can consent to specific uses, not just a blanket policy.
- **Revocable** — users may withdraw consent at any time without penalty.
- **Understandable** — consent language is plain and jargon-free.
- **Recorded** — consent actions are timestamped and auditable.

## Protection of User Autonomy

The platform is designed so that a user who shares the minimum amount of data receives the same quality of service as a user who shares more. There is no coercion, no dark patterns, and no tiered access that penalises privacy-conscious users.

Users are never pressured to share. Choosing not to share is always a first-class option.
