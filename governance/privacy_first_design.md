# Privacy-First Design Principles

## Purpose

This document defines the privacy-first design rules that govern every feature built on this platform. These rules are non-negotiable. They exist to ensure the platform remains a civic tool in service of its users — not a behavioural engine in service of data extraction.

## Core Rules

### Rule 1 — Ask, Don't Infer

The platform never infers user preferences from observed behaviour. If the platform needs to know something, it asks. Users provide information through explicit, voluntary disclosure. There is no passive data capture.

**In practice:** Charitable interests, support preferences, and personal circumstances are entered by the user, not detected by the system.

### Rule 2 — Purpose Clarity

Every piece of data collected has a clearly stated purpose, communicated to the user at the point of collection. Data is never collected "just in case" or for undefined future use.

**In practice:** When a user is asked for their location, they are told exactly why it is needed and what it enables. If they decline, the service continues without it.

### Rule 3 — Anonymity by Default

Users are anonymous unless they actively choose to be identified. Identification is always opt-in. No feature requires identification unless there is a clear, stated, and consented reason.

**In practice:** Survey responses, engagement data, and preference records are anonymous by default. Users may optionally attach their identity to records if they wish to receive personalised follow-up.

### Rule 4 — User Control

Users have full control over their data at all times. This includes the right to:

- View all data held about them.
- Correct any inaccuracies.
- Delete their data and account.
- Export their data in a readable format.
- Withdraw consent for any specific use without affecting other uses.

**In practice:** A user may delete their charitable interest profile without losing access to the platform. Withdrawing consent for one use does not withdraw consent for all uses.

### Rule 5 — No Secondary Use

Data collected for one purpose is never used for another purpose without renewed, explicit consent. User data is not shared with third parties, used for advertising, or analysed for commercial profiling.

**In practice:** A user's stated support preferences are used to surface relevant charities and services. They are not shared with those charities without the user's consent, and they are not used to infer anything beyond what the user has explicitly stated.

### Rule 6 — Fairness in Visibility

Platform visibility and service quality must not be contingent on the volume of data a user shares. Users who share the minimum data receive the same quality of service as users who share more.

**In practice:** A user who declines to share their location, accessibility needs, or support preferences is not penalised with reduced results, hidden features, or degraded experiences.

## What These Rules Prevent

Collectively, these rules ensure the platform cannot become:

- A behavioural profiling engine.
- A data broker.
- A surveillance tool.
- A dark pattern system that coerces data sharing.
- A commercial data asset built on unpaid user labour.

## Alignment

These principles align with:

- [CONSTITUTION.md](../CONSTITUTION.md) — Transparency, traceability, and fairness principles.
- [governance/charter.md](./charter.md) — Governance commitments including "soft guardrails" and "protection before profit".
- [governance/data_ethics_statement.md](./data_ethics_statement.md) — Full data ethics statement.
- [safeguards/consumer_protection_charter.md](../safeguards/consumer_protection_charter.md) — Consumer rights and protections.
