# GOVERNANCE CHARTER

## 1. Purpose

This charter defines how the Safe Cosmetics Marketplace is governed, maintained, and evolved.
It ensures that safety, clarity, and dignity remain non-negotiable.

## 2. Governance Roles

- **Stewards:** define principles, approve structural changes, oversee alignment with constitution.
- **Moderators:** apply rules to listings and sellers, manage incidents.
- **Compliance Leads:** interpret regulation, update safeguards, liaise with authorities.
- **Technical Maintainers:** implement and maintain automated checks, APIs, and audit trails.

## 3. Decision-Making

- Constitutional changes require Steward consensus.
- Governance rule changes require documented rationale and versioning.
- Operational changes (for example new checks) must be traceable via commits/PRs.

## 4. Safeguard Maintenance

- Prohibited and restricted lists are reviewed regularly.
- Risk models are updated from incident data and regulatory change.
- Documentation requirements are never weakened for commercial gain.

## 5. Accountability & Audit

- All governance changes are logged and versioned.
- All moderation actions are auditable.
- Serious safety incidents trigger formal review and, where necessary, regulator notification.

## 6. Cultural Commitments

Governance must always reflect:

- soft guardrails
- traceable authorship
- protection before profit
- no exploitation of regulatory grey zones
- no enabling unqualified actors

This charter is a living document, but its core commitments are not negotiable.
