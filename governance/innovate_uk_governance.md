# Innovate UK Governance Statement

## Purpose

This document provides a governance paragraph and supporting context suitable for inclusion in Innovate UK applications, funding submissions, and partner onboarding materials.

## Governance Paragraph (for direct use in applications)

> The platform operates a consent-first, user-centred governance model in which all personal data is provided directly and voluntarily by users, never inferred from behavioural observation or passive tracking. Users explicitly state their preferences, charitable interests, and support needs through structured, human-readable consent flows. No behavioural inference engine or secondary data profiling is employed. The governance framework aligns with safeguarding obligations across local authority partners, NHS partnerships, and Innovate UK ethical standards. All data use is ethical, proportionate, and accountable: data is collected for a stated purpose, held for a defined period, and never repurposed without renewed consent. Governance is maintained by a documented council structure with traceable authorship, versioned policy records, and a formal amendment process.

## Governance Model Detail

### Consent-First Design

Users are never enrolled into data collection by default. Every data interaction requires a clear, affirmative consent step before any information is stored or used. Consent is granular, revocable, and recorded with a timestamp.

### Direct Input, Not Behavioural Inference

The platform collects only what users choose to provide. It does not monitor activity patterns, infer intent from navigation behaviour, or construct predictive models of user preferences. This is a deliberate architectural decision, not a limitation — it reflects the platform's civic and ethical purpose.

### Safeguarding Alignment

The governance framework is designed to be compatible with the safeguarding standards required by:

- **Local authorities** — data minimisation, proportionality, and clear purpose limitation.
- **NHS partners** — privacy-by-design, no secondary use of sensitive data without consent.
- **Innovate UK** — ethical data use, public benefit, and accountable governance structures.

All safeguards are documented, versioned, and maintained by named governance roles as defined in the [Governance Charter](./charter.md).

### Ethical, Proportionate, and Accountable Data Use

Data is collected only when it is necessary for the stated purpose of the platform. The volume of data held is minimised. Users retain the right to view, correct, and delete their data at any time. No commercial use is made of user data without explicit, separate consent.

Governance decisions are logged and traceable. Policy changes follow a documented amendment process. Serious incidents trigger a formal review process as defined in the [Incident Response Protocol](./incident_response_protocol.md).
